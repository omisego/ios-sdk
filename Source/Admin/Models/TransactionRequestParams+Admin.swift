    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - type: The type of transaction to be generated (send of receive)
    ///   - tokenId: The unique identifier of the token that will be used in the transaction
    ///   - amount: The amount of token to use for the transaction (down to subunit to unit)
    ///             This amount needs to be either specified by the requester or the consumer
    ///   - address: The address from which to send or receive the tokens
    ///              If not specified, will use the primary wallet address by default
    ///   - accountId: The account id creating the request
    ///   - userId: The user id of the user for whom the request is created
    ///   - providerUserId: The provider user id of the user for whom the request is created
    ///   - correlationId: An id that can uniquely identify a transaction. Typically an order id from a provider.
    ///   - requireConfirmation: A boolean indicating if the request needs a confirmation from the requester before being proceeded
    ///   - maxConsumptions: The maximum number of time that this request can be consumed
    ///   - consumptionLifetime: The amount of time in milisecond during which a consumption is valid
    ///   - expirationDate: The date when the request will expire and not be consumable anymore
    ///   - allowAmountOverride: Allow or not the consumer to override the amount specified in the request
    ///                          This needs to be true if the amount is not specified
    ///   - maxConsumptionsPerUser: The maximum number of consumptions allowed per unique user
    ///   - consumptionIntervalDuration: The duration (in milliseconds) during which the maxConsumptionsPerInterval and
    ///     maxConsumptionsPerIntervalPerUser attributes take effect.
    ///   - maxConsumptionsPerInterval: The total number of times the request can be consumed in the defined interval
    ///     (like 3 times every 24 hours)
    ///   - maxConsumptionsPerIntervalPerUser: The total number of times one unique user can consume the request
    ///     (like once every 24 hours)
    ///   - exchangeAccountId: The account to use for the token exchange (if any)
    ///   - exchangeWalletAddress: The wallet address to use for the token exchange (if any)
    ///   - metadata: Additional metadata embeded with the request
    ///   - encryptedMetadata: Additional encrypted metadata embedded with the request
